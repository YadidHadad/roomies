#### Description:

Hello CS50 team!

My name is Yadid Hadad and I am an architect living in Israel. Besides architecture, in the last few years I found another passion which is programming.

Wanting to strengthen my programming core knowledge I signed myself up to the cs50 course and I was not wrong. It gave me a much wider perspective in cs core teachings.

After submitting all of the course tasks and exercises I was inspired in the final project to build an architectural portfolio that will allow me to showcase my 10 year career as I have wanted for a very long time. Though the data and imagery is still in process the web site structure is fully set for your consideration.

My project is a react web-app made while using next.js and deployed on vercel. my stack also includes mongodb to load projects from the database and create new or update them.

the main page is projects where all existing projects are loaded from the data base, while clicking on each project takes you to a project page where you can find the full project details.

As an admin I made a login route that allows me using a password to enter a dashboard page where I can add, update or delete from the database.

I also made an analytics page where visitors can keep track of the whole data presented on the page and have an overview on the data presented in the website.

Hope you have fun looking around!
